    "Computing has come a long way since the invention of the abacus that some consider the first computer. In the last 100 years the rate of evolution of technology has launched mankind into a new age. In 1965, Gordon Moore said that the number of transistors in a circuit would double every two years. This still holds true if you take it as meaning expenetial improvement rather than specific parameters like transistors."

    "The smallest processor ever built has been 3nm but there are talks of a 1nm on coming in the near future. These tiny spaces are approaching the atom, which is theoretically the limit.\n",
    "A computer in simple terms, performs an extremely large amount of very basic operations. Each one of them take barely any power to perform and don't mean much by themselves but when there are so many they can be used to work together and produce everything we use computers for now.\n",
    "Transistors are like an on or off switch that tells the computer if a bit is 0 or 1, on for 1 and off for 0. Multiple switches can form logic gates that perform different operations. From there you can use and combination or logic gates to create the programs we have today. \n",

    "While a lot faster at certain computation, it is hard to apply quantum computers to everyday problems right now because of how little is known about it. Both types of computers have there own strengths and differences to here is a few of the key areas where they do differ.\n",

    "**Classical Computers**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The power increase for classical computers is directly related to the amount of transistors so it is a 1: ratio with power to transistors.\n",
