# Emerging Technology

## Overview
This repository was created for the Emerging Technology(50669) module in the final year of  Atlantic Technological University (ATU).

The requirements for this project were to create a GitHub repository and two seperate Jupyter notebooks based on Scikit-Learn and Quantum Computing

The **Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook ** requirements:

* An overview the scikit-learn Python library 

* An example of using scikit-learn to perform regression. You may use any open
dataset you wish for this purpose, including any built-in to the library. Appropriate
plots and explanations in MarkDown should be included

* An example of using scikit-learn to perform classification. You may use any open
dataset you wish for this purpose, including any built-in to the library. Appropriate
plots and explanations in MarkDown should be included.


* An appropriate Dockerfile for the repository

The **Quantum Computing Jupyter Notebook** requirements:

* An explanation of quantum computing.

*  A clear and concise comparison of quantum computing and classical computing.


* An explanation of Deutsch’s algorithm.

* Code simulating Deutsch’s algorithm using qiskit.

The **GitHub Repository** requirements:

* Clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in
it, and how to run the notebooks.

* A Dockerfile and/or a docker-compose.yml file that enables someone to quickly
run your notebooks with minimal configuration. You should also include any other
required files, such as a requirements.txt file, data files, and image files.


All three of these files are in the base directory of this repository above.

## Requirements to run the Notebooks
### Step 1 - Clone the repository using one of 3 commands
***

HTTPS
```
https://github.com/EndaGoggin/Emerging_Technologies.git
```
SSH
```
git@github.com:EndaGoggin/Emerging_Technologies.git
```
Github CLI
```
gh repo clone EndaGoggin/Emerging_Technologies
```

### Step 2 - Install Anaconda on your machine from this link
***
```
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
```
### Step 3 - Install Jupyter Lab using Anacondas package manager
***
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

### Step 4 - Run this command in the repository root folder (Emerging_Technologies)
***
```
jupyter lab
```
### Step 5 - Use the opened browser window to select wither Notebook on the left hand side of the screen
